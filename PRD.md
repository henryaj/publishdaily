# PublishDaily Project Brief

## Overview
Creating an online version of the Inkhaven writing residency - a month-long daily writing challenge for November 2025 with financial commitment device and community support.

## Project Name
**PublishDaily** - emphasises the online publishing aspect and clear daily commitment.

## Core Concept
- Participants commit to publishing 500+ words every day for 30 days in November
- Single buy-in amount (likely Â£50) into shared pot - proper tontine structure
- Money gets split equally among all participants who complete the full challenge
- Discord/Slack community for support, accountability, and automatic post sharing
- Self-reported progress with URL submission for verification

## Immediate MVP Goal
Build a simple HTML landing page on GitHub Pages (publishdaily.henrystanley.com) with:
- Compelling copy explaining the challenge
- Airtable form for interest collection
- Basic info about rules and timeline

## Airtable Sign-up Form Fields
- Name
- Email  
- Twitter/social handle (optional)
- Writing experience level (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- Preferred buy-in amount (to gauge pricing sensitivity)
- What do you hope to get out of this?
- Any topics you're particularly interested in writing about?
- How did you hear about this?

## Key Rules
- 500+ word minimum per post
- Must be published publicly (any platform: personal blog, Medium, Substack, etc.)
- Posted before midnight UK time
- Original content only
- Miss a day = out of tontine (but can continue for community support)

## Technical Architecture (Future)
- Simple web app for user management and progress tracking
- Discord server with automated post-sharing bot
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Daily check-in system with URL submission
- Public progress dashboard

## Current Status
- Got blessing from habryka (Inkhaven organiser) on LessWrong
- Need to validate interest with sign-up form before building full platform
- Targeting launch for November 2025

## Next Steps
1. Build GitHub Pages landing site with Airtable form
2. Share on LessWrong, Twitter, EA Forum to gauge interest
3. If 20+ sign-ups, proceed with community building and payment setup
4. If successful, build out full web app for November execution

## Design Considerations
- Keep initial version simple - avoid over-engineering
- Focus on community and accountability mechanisms
- Make the financial commitment meaningful but not exclusionary
- Emphasise this is deliberately challenging, not casual
